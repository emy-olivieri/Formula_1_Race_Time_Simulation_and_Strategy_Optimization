# TODO List

## In Progress:
- [ ] Clean and thoroughly comment the code to improve readability and maintainability.
- [ ] Implement time loss adjustments based on grid positions at the start of the race.
- [ ] Redesign the architecture to store model outputs for each driver in a specific race and save them in a CSV/Excel file to avoid re-running the model for every simulation.
- [ ] Optimize the running time by parallelizing simulations and improving dataset handling.
- [ ] Improve the existing models for better accuracy and performance.
- [ ] Develop and integrate a first-lap and overtaking model.
